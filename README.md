# End to End Capstone Machine Learning Project

## Abstract:
- This is an End to End project on **real world** retail sector data. This project covers everything from data preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, model builing, hyperparameter tuning and finally building the webapp and deploying on AWS.

## There are 4 modules in this Project:
-  Price Predictor : This module predicts approximate price of a property when user provides input
-  Analytics Module : This module displays extensive visualisations involving different aspects of retail sector in Gurgaon
-  Recommender System : This module recommends similar properties to the user given a user input
-  Insights Module : This module provides valuable insights which helps the user take decision regarding property purchase

  
## Steps involved in this Project:

- Gathered real world data on house prices. The data has detailed information about properties in Gurgaon.
- Data preprocessing of individual csv files - flats and houses. Merged the 2 files after preprocessing
- Engineering features for our data from existing attributes
- Performing univariate and multivariate data analysis to draw insights on data
- Outlier detection and removal from data
- Imputing missing values in data
- Selecting and engineering features for our machine learning model
- Creating a Baseline model

# End to End Capstone Machine Learning Project

Abstract:
- This is an End to End project on real world retail sector data. This project covers everything from data preprocessing, cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, model builing, hyperparameter tuning and finally building the webapp and deploying on AWS.
  
Steps involved in this Project:
- Gathered real world data on house prices. The data has detailed information about properties in Gurgaon.
- Data preprocessing of individual csv files - flats and houses. Merged the 2 files after preprocessing
- Engineering features for our data from existing attributes
- Performing univariate and multivariate data analysis to draw insights on data
- Outlier detection and removal from data
- Imputing missing values in data
- Selecting and engineering features for our machine learning model
- Creating a Baseline model
